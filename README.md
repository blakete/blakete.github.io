# Blake's Research Index

## Introduction
This research index tracks, collates, and distills data related to Blakeâ€™s resesrch interests. The mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for Blake and his readers to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the fields under investigation. [I took inspiration from 1's Introduction section]. For the sake of accuracy, this public index will lag and only partially mirror my private index.
