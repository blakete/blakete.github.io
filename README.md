## Introduction
The Blake Index report tracks, collates, and distills data related to his resesrch interests. Our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for him and his readers to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the fields he investigates. [I took inspiration from 1's Introduction section]. For the sake of accuracy, this public index will lag and only partially mirror my private index.
