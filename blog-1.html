<p>
    This page will dive into the concepts of physics that are most essential for guiding our lives. Follow the physics and the 
    universe will reward you for optimizing its machinery. Be a custodian and help facilitate the energy process the universe 
    is continually undergoing. Optimize the system on its behalf. Why do you think you were given consciousness?

<h2>The Principles Governing Matter and Energy</h2>
<h3>Newtownian Mechanics</h3>

<h3>Quantum Mechanics</h3>


<h3>The Law of Conservation of Mass</h3>
<p>
    The law of conservation of mass states that the mass of a system is constant. Mass can be neither created nor destroyed, but it can be converted into energy.
</p>
<h3>Law of Conservation of Energy</h3>
<p>
    The principles of conservation of energy state that the total energy of a system is constant. Energy can be neither created nor destroyed, but it can be converted from one form to another.
</p>
<h3>Law of Convservation of Momentum</h3>
<p>
    The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a system is constant. Momentum can be neither created nor destroyed, but it can be transferred from one object to another.
</p>
<h3>The Principle of Least Action</h3>
<p>
    The principle of least action states that the path of a particle is the path of least action. This principle is based on the principle of least time, which states that the path of a light ray is the path of least time.
</p>
<h3>The Principle of Least Time</h3>
<p>
    The principle of least time states that the path of a light ray is the path of least time. This principle is based on the principle of least action, which states that the path of a particle is the path of least action.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see, there is a reciprocal interplay between the principle of least action and the principle of least time. 
    A particle acts as a wave and a wave acts as a particle.

<h2>Mass</h2>
<p>
    Measure of an objects inertia.
    The more inertia an object has the greater its gravity.
    Powerful concepts in the mind have intertia, mass, and a force field of their own, similar to gravity.
    People around you can sense it if your ideas are powerful enough. They will listen to you and follow you.
    People obey the laws of physics.
    Our mind is an energy field. The energy field knows the right way.
