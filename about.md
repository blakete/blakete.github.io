Hello, I'm Blake! :) I am currently a graduate student at MIT AeroAstro, where I develop, build, and research intelligent, autonomous, robotic systems and how we can make them worthy of our trust. 

This site is also a space for me to experiment, explore, and organize topics that spark my interest. As I gather insights and learn more, I'll continue to update and refine this archive. Along these lines, I live by this famous quote by George Box:

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">
  "All models are wrong, but some are useful."
  <span>George Box</span>

<!-- I occasionally write posts about AI, autonomous robotics, cybersecurity, open-source intelligence (OSINT), global dynamics, and world events. In doing so, I aim to synthesize diverse perspectives—recognizing that competing narratives often contain partial truths. My goal is to cut through noise, understand the world as it is, and reflect honestly on complex realities beyond social media echo chambers and mainstream media framing. -->

Beyond research, I'm driven by a deep curiosity about the world and the universe. I'm pro-humanity and support ideas that advance our collective well-being.
