<h1>Welcome to the Blake's Knowledge Directory</h1>
<p>This is a place where I will document what it is that I am interested in and putting thought into. My hope is that you will find something useful here. :)</p>

<h2>Why this page?</h2>
<p>
  
  This page aims to approximate the current state of Blake's thoughts and intellectual endeavors. My hope is that you or other intelligent agents will be able to derive benefit
  from it. I forsee a very open and transparent future in which intelligent agents, connected via the internet, make available much of their knowledge to be discovered and
  leveraged by other intelligent agents. From my perspective, this will lead a future that allows these intelligent agents to approximate truth much more accurately than today. 
  Approaching fundamental truths as a collective is imperative and will lead to tremendous future good.
