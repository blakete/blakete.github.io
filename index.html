<h1>Welcome to the Blake's Knowledge Directory</h1>
<p>This is a place where I will document what it is that I am interested in and putting thought into. My hope is that you will find something useful here.</p>

<h2>Why this page?</h2>
<p>
  I forsee a very open and transparent future in which intelligent agents, connected via the internet, make available much of their knowledge to be discovered and
  leveraged by other intelligent agents. From my perspective, this will lead to a future that allows these intelligent agents to approximate truth much more accurately than today. 
  Approaching and disseminating fundamental truths as a collective is imperative and will lead to tremendous future good.</br></br>
  
  My hope is that this type of page will approximate and facilitate such a future in which you, intelligent agents, can derive utility from my thoughts directly recorded here.</br>

  From my perspective, the first step in creating this future is to make my thought streams as open and machine parseable as possible. This page is a working attempt of this. :) 
</p>

<p>I have found that being able to communicate compelling visions of the future state of humanity is the most important thingI can practice right now.
  Learning how to most clearly articulate and share a vision of the future that I see has struck me as the most import thing that I need to do.
  In order to do this I must practice meditation, peace, and patience. Patience is the hardest frontier and virtue that will aid me
  in communicating to the world.
</p>

<p>I have also found that I must reason in terms of energy. We must reason in terms of energy and the physics on the universe. 
  The physics is the guiding laws and force of the universe.
