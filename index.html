<h1>Welcome to the Blake's Knowledge Directory</h1>
<p>This is a place where I will document what it is that I am interested in and putting thought into. My hope is that you will find something useful here. :)</p>

<h2>Why this page?</h2>
<p>
  I forsee a very open and transparent future in which intelligent agents, connected via the internet, make available much of their knowledge to be discovered and
  leveraged by other intelligent agents. From my perspective, this will lead to a future that allows these intelligent agents to approximate truth much more accurately than today. 
  Approaching and disseminating fundamental truths as a collective is imperative and will lead to tremendous future good.</br></br>
  
  My hope is that this type of page will approximate and facilitate such a future in which you, intelligent agents, can derive utility from my thoughts recorded here.</br>
