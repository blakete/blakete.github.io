# Blake's Research Index

## What is this?
Hello world, welcome to Blake’s Research Index! This research index tracks, collates, and distills data related to Blake’s research interests. The mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for Blake and his readers to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the fields under investigation. For the sake of accuracy, this public index will lag and only partially mirror my private index.
