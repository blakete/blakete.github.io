Here are some notable quotes from their accompanying paper (linked below):
- ‚ÄúThe findings reveal that RL empower DeepSeek-R1-Zero to attain robust reasoning capabilities without the need for any supervised fine-tuning data. This is a noteworthy achievement, as it underscores the model‚Äôs ability to learn and generalize effectively through RL alone.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe self-evolution process of DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a fascinating demonstration of how RL can drive a model to improve its reasoning capabilities autonomously.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally acquires the ability to solve increasingly complex reasoning tasks by leveraging extended test-time compu- tation. This computation ranges from generating hundreds to thousands of reasoning tokens, allowing the model to explore and refine its thought processes in greater depth.‚Äù
- ‚Äúrather than explicitly teaching the model on how to solve a problem, we simply provide it with the right incentives, and it autonomously develops advanced problem-solving strategies.‚Äù

Feels like an AlphaGo like moment for LLMs!

What didn't work for them:

Also, they explored using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to enhance language model inference by breaking answers into stepwise components guided by a pre-trained value model. However, they found that scaling training faced key hurdles such as token generation‚Äôs exponentially larger search space (vs. chess) led to local optima when constraining node expansions and training a sufficiently precise value model to guide iterative improvement was difficult and didn‚Äôt yield great results. While MCTS boosts inference-time performance with a pre-trained value model, achieving self-improvement through iterative self-search with an MCTS approach remains a challenge.

They also tried Process Reward Modeling (PRM) and found it also wasn‚Äôt great because vague stepwise evaluation (ill-defined intermediate steps and unreliable automated/manual verification) and reward hacking/training instability outweighed its benefits in guided search or reranking.

Also they say ‚ÄúThrough RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing.‚Äù Which reminds me of a conversation I had with someone a while ago:
"Like AlphaGo branching through its game tree using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL), my understanding is that o1 performs meta-prompting to iteratively query and refine its navigation through its own latent space via token feedback. In the limit, this process naturally converges on whichever token sequences‚Äîregardless of language‚Äîbest help o1 steer, ‚Äúreason‚Äù, and carry intermediate information to yield the most rewarded + probable answer. In line with ‚ÄúEmbers of Auto-Regression,‚Äù which shows these models often perform better on problems that appear more frequently in their training corpus, o1 may learn to switch to another language if it‚Äôs more likely to correctly solve a sub-problem in that language, then steer itself back to the target language for the final output. Over time, it will probably increasingly blend words across languages or invent entirely new token patterns if they prove more effective for internal latent space trajectory steering/reasoning‚Äîso, yes, I believe it may very well ‚Äúthink‚Äù better in a different language!" - [X Post Source](https://x.com/humanity_dao/status/1877219387930796159)

"üö®The Bitter Lesson Proves Right‚ÄîAgain.üö®

Rich Sutton‚Äôs iconic essay The Bitter Lesson argued that AI breakthroughs come not from human-crafted rules, but from general methods that scale with computation. The latest paper on DeepSeek-R1-Zero is yet another validation of this truth.

DeepSeek-R1-Zero abandons supervised fine-tuning and RLHF for learning how to reason, and instead relies on reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously drive iterative self-improvement. Like AlphaGo/AlphaZero, which rejected handcrafted heuristics in favor of massive iterative self-play, DeepSeek-R1-Zero leverages extensive test-time compute, speculative rollouts, and reward-driven optimization to explore solutions and refine policies based on environment feedback. Its reward system relies on rule-based verification, allowing it to bypass neural reward modeling, direct human feedback, and supervised training on human reasoning traces.

By embracing open-ended computation over trying to encode human intuition, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exemplifies Sutton‚Äôs thesis: general intelligence will arise from scaling compute to its fullest potential." - [X Post Source](https://x.com/humanity_dao/status/1884283455443181636)

TODO: add the token prediction training efficiency thing here.

Other interesting theories:
- CCP PsyOp theory:
    - "deepseek is a ccp state psyop + economic warfare to make american ai unprofitable. they are faking the cost was low to justify setting price low and hoping everyone switches to it damage AI competitiveness in the us. dont take the bait" [source X Post](https://x.com/nealkhosla/status/1882859736737194183)
