No hype, just facts—quantum’s creeping closer.

### State of Quantum Computing
Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip, with 8 topological qubits, promises a breakthrough: slashing error rates via physics, not fixes, aiming for smaller, simpler, scalable quantum computers. It’s a prototype—cryogenic, not room-temp—but a big step toward millions of qubits. Others (Google, IBM) lead in qubit count, but errors hobble them.

### Why Care?
Quantum computing could crack problems—crypto, drug design, logistics—that classical machines choke on. Topological qubits might get us there faster, skipping years of scaling pain. It’s a race worth watching.

### Timeline of Key Innovations
- **2025:** Microsoft’s Majorana 1 debuts topological qubits—8 now, aiming for a million, with error rates way down.
- **2023:** IBM hits 433 qubits, still noisy as hell.
- **2019:** Google claims "quantum supremacy" with 53 qubits—disputed, but a milestone.
- **2011:** D-Wave sells first commercial quantum annealer (limited use).
- **1998:** First 2-qubit quantum computer demos basic ops.
- **1994:** Shor’s algorithm shows quantum can break encryption, sparking interest.
