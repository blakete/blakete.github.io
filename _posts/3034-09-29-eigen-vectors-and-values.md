## What the heck are eigenvectors and eigenvalues!?
- The German prefix "eigen" roughly translates to "self", "own", "intrinsic", "inherent", or "characteristic".
- An eigenvector of Ais a vector that is taken to a multiple of itself by the matrix transformation T(x) =Ax, whichperhaps explains the terminology.
