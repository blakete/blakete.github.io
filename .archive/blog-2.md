# Important Concepts of How the Brain Works
My notes as I try to grasp these important concepts.
Inspired by Jeffrey Hawkins.

## The brain is composed of the new part and the older parts.

## How the neocortex learns a model of the world.

## Older parts of the brain generated our emotion and more primitive behaviors.

## How the old brain can take control, causing use to act in ways we know we shouldn't.

## All of us are susceptible to false beliefs and some beliefs are viral.

## Many of our problems are caused by false beliefs and selfish desires of the old brain or both.
