  Hi, this is a page that will live track my interests. It is a continuous measurement of what I am working on, exploring, and am interested in.

  I am imaging this page as a place that shows key words. Like one of those pages where the font size of the word is the frequency of occurrence. This is a continuous self reflective. exercise that would be really interesting to watch develop over time. I imagine keeping track of what I am doing and am interested in over time by writing what I am working on into a text box and having that update the blob of entities over time. Super fun! :)

  As always, let me know if you have any thoughts, questions, or additions. :)
