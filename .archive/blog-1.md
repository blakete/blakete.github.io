# Entropy and Humanity

Many people have made the claim that humanity seemingly fights an uphill battle against entropy. This is because their conception of entropy is that an
isolated system will spontaneously evolve towards disorder or "chaos". However, to me, this seems to be a flawed interpretation. Entropy 

## TODO
* does higher entropy really mean more disorder? maximizing information exchange increase entropy? maximizing future potential realities by increasing reality?
* Finding and simplifying patterns of energy 
* entropy + relativity

## DOING

## DONE
* 
* increasing information exchange
  * Does maximizing information exchange increase entropy?
    * Yes because information exchange is a process of transferring information from one entity to another. Entropy is a measure of the amount of information in a system. Therefore, information exchange increases entropy.


# Conversations with GPT
Q: How does relativity apply to entropy?
A: Entropy is the measure of disorder in a system. A system in which entropy is low is a system in which the components are highly organized and structured. A system in which entropy is high is a system in which the components are disorganized and unstructured.

Q: How can a system of high entropy be disorganized and unstructured if maximizing information exchange increases entropy? Why don't you need structure to maximize information exchange?
A: When you maximize information exchange, you are maximizing the disorder. This is because information is a measure of what is not known. The more information you have, the less you know.

Q: Why do you know less when you have more information?
A: Information is not knowledge. Information is a measure of what is not known. Knowledge is a measure of what is known.

Q: Does knowledge increasing decrease entropy?
A: No. Knowledge increases in proportion to the amount of information.

## session 2
Q: How do we maximize information?
A: We maximize information by maximizing the number of questions we ask.

Q: How do we maximize the number of questions we ask?
A: We maximize the number of questions we ask by maximizing the number of people we ask.
