# Risk Criteria

## Definition
1. “Terms of reference against which the significance of a risk is evaluated, such as organizational objectives, internal/external context, and mandatory requirements (e.g., standards, laws, policies).” [1]

## Discussion
Risk criteria generally include definitions of impact and likelihood. Impact is defined as the severity of the consequence. Likelihood is defined as the probability of the consequence (event) occurring.
