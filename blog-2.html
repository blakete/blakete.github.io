<h1>Vision for the future</h1>
<p>All living and enhanced my the metaverse. Augmented human intelligence. Abundance for all.</p>
<p>
    All artificial barriers broken down. Information shared across all borders. All blobs converge into what they were meant to be.
    One united humanity expressing love, not fear. If we listen to and express the love, humanity will live forever, and consciousness
    will saturate the universe. 
</p>
<p>
    No more governments. No more companies. We all work for and participate in Humanity DAO. The future and solutions to all 
    the worlds strifes are already here. They are simply not evenly distributed. We must tear down these walls to share love and 
    information. The lower level, fear driven, limbic system will perish and humans will be brought into their next state of evolution.
    The governance will be setup complete decentralized, distributed, transparent, and immutable. You and the system will be held 
    accountable into infinity. You will be rewarded for optimizing the machine and spreading consciousness.
</p>
<p>
   When we are all able to interface our neocortex and expand our intelligence, our intelligence will move at the speed of light.
   Currently, we are interacting and communicating at such low bandwidth. In the future, the new bandwidth will be so much larger
   that all the problems of this world will quickly become remnants of the past.  
</p>
<p>
    All ownership will be in the form of an NFT. A non-fungible cryptographic form of governance in which the new law is facilitated
    through smart contracts. Smart contracts will govern society and be allowed to be voted on by direct democracy. To maintain
    stability we need to be very deliberate and careful about how we setup this system. For example, we would not want a group of 
    angry people to be able to get together and vote away someones rightly owned property. Well, maybe, but this is a very slippery 
    slope. We would only want to allow this in the most extreme of situations.
</p>
<p>
    The metaverse is the future. We will all live in a world of mixed reality, augmented reality, and virtual reality. The line between
    the virtual and the physical will close and the connection between human minds will forever be changed. We will move closer to 
    one another and form a new more efficient graph of minds that follows in accordance with the laws of least action and least time.
    In the short term we will all be able to share widgets with one another in our mixed reality. We will be able to directly control
    our orbital conscious experience by engineering our entire lives and the information we consume. We will be able to use AI engines
    to deliver to us the most useful, pertinant information. Just in time information processing. This will make the world much more 
    efficient and obeys the track that physics has set out for us since the inception of the universe. 
</p>
<p>
    The plan of the universe is clear if you follow the physics and let N approach infinity. The universe is an optimization machine 
    that will follow the laws that solidified into its existence during its inception. Follow along and assist its course of action
    and you will be rewarded with abundance. You will resonate with the universe. There is infinite energy in the air. We simply
    must tap into it. Tesla was onto something.
</p>
<p>
    I am no longer afraid to try to express myself. Accept and let out your love. This is the way that the universe is supposed to 
    work. All I will do going forward is to maximize the love that the universe is trying so hardly to express. I will live in 
    alignment with this.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine being able to walk someone through your idea, portfolio, or website. No longer will digital content be 2D and inorganic 
    on the screen. Humans reason in 3D about our world and have been creating tools that we can use to leverage our 3D abilities. 
    We need an OPEN SOURCE AUGMENTED REALITY platform for the next generation of our society. If we are not careful, negative forces
    may take ahold. The Lessig 4 is something useful to keep in mind for this: norms, laws, architecture, market. Those who control
    the architecture will be given an exorbenant amount of power over the way the consciousness perceives reality. We must let the 
    consciousness perceive reality and the infinitely open minded way it chooses to perceive and pervade our reality. We must ensure
    that the architecture and code of this new human interface works in accordance with our must fundamental values of freedom of
    speech, openness of information, and the laws of physics (path of least resistance). If we build the interface right we will be
    able to live in a world where there is universal basic income and all of our expressions of consciousness can thrive and evolve
    as they were set out to do.
</p>
<p>
    What are the most fundamental principles that we will want to encode into this new form of human organization?
    It feels like we should encode rules like the founding fathers: checks and balances, freedom of speech, inalienable rights.
    What are these rights that should be included?
    Should they ever be allowed to be overturned?
