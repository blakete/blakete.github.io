<h1>Priorities</h1>

<p>
    Trying to understand where my priorities lie. I am constantly switching between projects, ideas, and pursuits. I feels
    a bit frustrated by this. I want to pursue, work towards, and feel fulfilled by something long term. Ever since I can remember
    I had so many ideas and had a tough time having the discipline to stick with any one of them to make them come to fruition.
    I am tired of this. I want to start making sense of the many ideas and things that I pursue. At least start documenting them
    so that I may reflect on them and make sense on the bigger picture I am stumbling towards. If I really think about how I have 
    stumbled intellectually all of my life I would actually identify it as my strength. I am able to unify subjects across domains 
    and make connections and semenatic linkeages that many other people would not have made.
