<h1>Your conscious in orbit</h1>
<p>
    Your consciousness is the result of reentrant signal integration of disparate neural processes. By building tools with this in
    mind we can build a new mindset and therefore reality of ourself. I present to you orbit. Where you can take, concepts, ideas, 
    and cast them out into orbit to come back to you at a specified date so that they can come back into you and you can integrate 
    them into yourself to lead the life that you want to live. 
</p>
<p>
    We are always in this struggle to remember what we want, to live how we want, to live in accordance with our values. The 
    consistency and realiability of our machines can help us with this and help us lead the life we want to live.
