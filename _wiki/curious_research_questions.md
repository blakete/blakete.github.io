* "How much stochasticity can be tolerated at the substrate before the higher-level emergent properties collapse to look random?"
    * Related work is lambda parameter that shows qualitative breakdown.
* if you keep the program deterministic and unchanging and you can sample from it what can you estimate abou the generating process or program?
* are there programs that have non-determinism/stochasticity/randomness that have emergent determinism / stability that can be predicted to look stable? (e.g. Newtownian mechanics at the level of atoms?)
