- one piece of a bigger puzzle that feels important.

## Free Energy Minimization Principle

All unified by this one principle:
- Love
- Truth
- control, planning
- theory of brain
- physics
- natural progression
- manifestation matching reality waves with coherent waves held in your head.

Mathematical definition of it.

- future connect entropy and other ohysical  laws

Decisionâ€‘making under uncertainty is the information projection of a passive path law onto an exponentially tilted family induced by rewards/preferences.

All of control, planning, and active inference are different factorizations/metrics/constraints of this one projection.

To decide under uncertainty, pick a trajectory distribution your system can actually realize that is closest in KL to a Gibbs/tilted distribution that favors high-reward futures--everything else (control, planning, active inference) is just a different way of factorizing or constraining that same projection problem.

Decision-making under uncertainty = pick a trajectory distribution by KL-projecting the passive dynamics onto the Gibbs family defined by your rewards.

Control, planning, and active inference are just different ways to factor and solve that same projection problem, or to swap in slightly different divergences/constraints.
