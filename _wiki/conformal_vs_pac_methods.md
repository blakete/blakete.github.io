This page provides a comprehensive comparison between **Conformal Prediction** and **Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning** methods, two fundamentally different approaches to providing guarantees in machine learning.

---

## Framework Overview

### Conformal Prediction
- **Goal**: Quantify prediction uncertainty with **guaranteed coverage**
- **Output**: Prediction sets/intervals with valid coverage probability
- **Guarantee**: $\mathbb{P}(Y_{new} \in C_\alpha(X_{new})) \geq 1-\alpha$ (coverage)
- **Focus**: **Post-hoc** uncertainty quantification for any trained model

### PAC Learning  
- **Goal**: Bound **generalization error** of learning algorithms
- **Output**: Hypothesis with bounded error probability
- **Guarantee**: $\mathbb{P}(\text{err}(h) \leq \epsilon) \geq 1-\delta$ (accuracy + confidence)
- **Focus**: **Learning-time** guarantees for algorithm design

---

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Conformal Prediction | PAC Learning |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Primary Question** | "How uncertain am I about this prediction?" | "How well will my algorithm generalize?" |
| **When Applied** | At test time (post-training) | During learning (training time) |
| **Model Dependence** | Model-agnostic wrapper | Fundamental to algorithm design |
| **Distributional Assumptions** | Exchangeability only | Distribution-free (any distribution) |
| **Sample Complexity** | Fixed calibration set size | Adaptive based on $\epsilon, \delta$ |
| **Computational Focus** | Efficient calibration procedure | Polynomial-time learnability |

---

## Mathematical Guarantees

### Coverage vs Accuracy

**Conformal Prediction** guarantees **marginal coverage**:
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y_{n+1} \in C_\alpha(X_{n+1})) \geq 1 - \alpha
$$
- **Interpretation**: Fraction of future predictions with correct coverage
- **Validity**: Exact finite-sample guarantee under exchangeability
- **Limitation**: Only marginal coverage, not conditional on $X$

**PAC Learning** guarantees **generalization accuracy**:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\text{err}_D(h) \leq \epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta
$$
- **Interpretation**: Probability that learned hypothesis has low error
- **Validity**: Worst-case over all distributions and concepts
- **Limitation**: Asymptotic focus, may be conservative

### Assumption Differences

| Framework | Key Assumption | Strength | Limitation |
|-----------|---------------|----------|------------|
| **Conformal** | Exchangeability $(Z_1, \ldots, Z_{n+1})$ | Weaker than i.i.d. | Violated under covariate shift |
| **PAC** | Distribution-agnostic | Works for any distribution | Ignores beneficial structure |

## Practical Applications

### When to Use Conformal Prediction

✅ **Ideal Scenarios:**
- **Post-hoc uncertainty** for existing models
- **Safety-critical decisions** requiring coverage guarantees  
- **Model deployment** with uncertainty quantification
- **Any ML model** (neural networks, random forests, etc.)
- **Regulatory compliance** requiring statistical guarantees

**Example**: Medical diagnosis system that must provide confidence intervals for predictions to meet FDA requirements.

### When to Use PAC Learning

✅ **Ideal Scenarios:**
- **Algorithm design** and theoretical analysis
- **Sample complexity** planning for data collection
- **Learning theory** research and understanding
- **Worst-case guarantees** across all possible scenarios
- **Computational complexity** analysis of learning problems

**Example**: Designing a learning algorithm for autonomous vehicles with provable sample complexity bounds.

## Complementary Aspects

### They Can Work Together

**Sequential Application:**
1. **PAC Learning**: Design algorithm with guaranteed sample complexity
2. **Conformal Prediction**: Add uncertainty quantification to trained model

**Example Workflow:**
```
Data Collection → PAC-guided Algorithm Design → Model Training → Conformal Calibration → Deployment
```

### Bridging Methods

**PAC-Bayes Meets Conformal:**
- PAC-Bayesian bounds can incorporate conformal-style techniques
- Conformal prediction can use PAC-inspired confidence measures

**Online Learning Connections:**
- Online conformal prediction adapts coverage over time
- Online PAC learning adapts hypotheses with mistake bounds

---

## Theoretical Comparison

### Sample Complexity

**Conformal Prediction:**
- **Calibration set size**: Typically $n \sim 1/\alpha$ for coverage level $1-\alpha$
- **Fixed requirement**: Doesn't depend on model complexity
- **Efficiency**: Depends on base model quality (better models → smaller prediction sets)

**PAC Learning:**
- **Training set size**: $m \sim O(\text{VCdim}(\mathcal{H})/\epsilon + \log(1/\delta)/\epsilon)$
- **Adaptive requirement**: Scales with hypothesis class complexity
- **Efficiency**: Measured by achieving target accuracy $\epsilon$

### Computational Complexity

**Conformal Prediction:**
- **Calibration**: $O(n \log n)$ for quantile computation
- **Prediction**: $O(1)$ to $O(|\mathcal{Y}|)$ depending on output space
- **Model-agnostic**: Inherits base model's computational cost

**PAC Learning:**
- **Learning**: Must be polynomial-time for efficient PAC learnability
- **Prediction**: Depends on hypothesis representation
- **Algorithm-specific**: Computational guarantee is part of learning framework

## Coverage vs Conditional Coverage

### Conformal Prediction Limitations

**Marginal Coverage Only:**
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y \in C_\alpha(X)) \geq 1-\alpha \quad \text{(guaranteed)}
$$

**Conditional Coverage Not Guaranteed:**
$$
\mathbb{P}(Y \in C_\alpha(X) | X = x) \geq 1-\alpha \quad \text{(generally false)}
$$

**Solutions:**
- Localized conformal prediction
- Conformalized quantile regression
- Mondrian conformal prediction

### PAC Learning Advantages

**Distribution-Free Guarantees:**
- Works uniformly over **all possible distributions**
- No need for distribution-specific calibration
- Provides **worst-case** guarantees

**Conditional Guarantees:**
- Error bound holds for **any input distribution**
- No conditioning issues like conformal prediction

- **Distribution-free prediction sets**: Beyond marginal coverage
- **Conformal risk control**: Generalized loss functions
- **Causal conformal prediction**: Counterfactual uncertainty

### PAC Learning Evolution

**Modern Developments:**

## Empirical Considerations

### Performance Metrics

**Conformal Prediction:**
- **Coverage rate**: Fraction of true labels in prediction sets
- **Efficiency**: Average size of prediction sets
- **Conditional coverage**: Coverage across different subgroups

**PAC Learning:**
- **Generalization error**: Test error vs training error gap
- **Sample complexity**: Required data for target accuracy
- **Computational efficiency**: Runtime scaling

### Real-World Challenges

**Conformal Prediction:**
- **Distribution shift**: Coverage degrades under covariate shift
- **Computational cost**: Can be expensive for large output spaces
- **Calibration set**: Requires held-out validation data

**PAC Learning:**
- **Realizability**: Target concept may not be in hypothesis class
- **Worst-case bounds**: May be too conservative for practice
- **Finite-sample behavior**: Theory focuses on asymptotic limits
