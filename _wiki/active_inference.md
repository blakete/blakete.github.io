Active inference, grounded in the Free Energy Principle, provides such a foundation by minimizing Expected Free Energy
(EFE), a cost function that combines utility with epistemic drives, such
as ambiguity resolution and novelty seeking.

### **Active inference formulation of the Free-Energy Principle**

“Active and internal states minimize a free energy functional of sensory states” means that both your beliefs (internal states, μ) and your motor outputs (active states, a) evolve so as to reduce an information‐theoretic free energy bound on your sensory surprise. This co‐minimization is what underlies perception (belief updating) and action (environmental sampling) in the brain’s self-organizing loop.
