## Key Ideas

Wolfram proposes that the universe operates like a computational system, governed by simple rules that, when executed, generate the complexity we observeâ€”space, time, matter, and physical laws.

Wolfram suggests the universe is a discrete, computational structure, akin to a cellular automaton or a graph-based system.

Computational irreducability: systems where the outcome of a process cannot be predicted without performing the full, step-by-step computation.

**Ruliad**: a structure that encompasses all possible computations and perspectives. It represents the ultimate computational object, containing every possible rule and outcome.

Human consciousness and perception are computational processes within this framework.

## Scratch Notes

How does Stephen Wolfram relate the **2nd law of thermodynamics** to **computational irreducability** and **observer limitations**?

Computational irreducability as Wolfram describes it refers to systems where the outcome of a process cannot be predicted without performing the full, step-by-step computation. In systems that have computational reducabilitiies we can find and exploit "shortcuts" or higher-level patterns that allow us to predict outcomes. 

Computationally irreducable systems require us to compute every single step in order to know the result.Such systems generate complex, non-repeating patterns that lack exploitable shortcuts.

**Computationally bounded observers**: Wolfram discusses how even if a system of interest has underlying symmetries, detecting or exploiting them requires computing the full history or state. This is generally infeasible for computationally irreducible systems.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that a system will tend toward disorder (increasing entropy). Wolfram argues that the Second Law emerges because irreducible computations produce states that look random to the computationally bounded observer.
