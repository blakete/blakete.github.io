## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. It makes predictions based on that data and is corrected when those predictions are wrong.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.
