### ðŸ§  **TL;DR**

Planning and control can be framed as Bayesian inference: by treating costs as (unnormalized) likelihoods and dynamics as priors, decision-making reduces to inferring a posterior over optimal trajectories.

---

Nearly all planning, optimal control, and reinforcement learning algorithms can be derived as **variational inference problems** of the form:

$$
\min_Q\;\mathbb{E}_Q[C(\tau)] + \mathrm{KL}(Q(\tau) \,\|\, P(\tau))
$$

by varying:

* the form of the **prior** $P(\tau)$ â€” e.g. passive dynamics, old policy, or expert behavior;
* the expressivity of the **variational family** $Q(\tau)$ â€” e.g. deterministic plans, stochastic policies, hierarchical structures;
* the **approximation scheme** â€” e.g. sampling, linearization, or taking a low-temperature limit.

This objective comes from the free energy functional:

$$
\mathcal{F}[Q] = \mathbb{E}_Q[C(\tau)] + \mathrm{KL}(Q(\tau) \,\|\, P(\tau))
$$

and serves as a **master equation** that unifies an entire zoo of methods and algorithms.

This conceptual model can be especially helpful in research and theory development, since many disparate algorithms become special cases of the same principle!

To make this master objective practical, we must always consider the **underlying approximations**: linearizations, sampling methods, limited expressivity in $Q$, or surrogate optimization schemes.

Overall, I have found the Free-Energy Principle to serve as a very useful heuristic and unifying principle.
