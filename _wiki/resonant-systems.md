You have a system that vibrates. You're pushing it from outside. How do you get the most energy in?

Your instinct says *push harder*. Your instinct is wrong.

## The Setup

A driven damped oscillator has three knobs: how hard you push (F₀), when you push relative to the system's motion (φ), and how much energy the system bleeds to friction (γ).

The steady-state energy stored in the system is:

**E = F₀² cos²(φ) / (8γ²mω₀²)**

Read that formula carefully. It tells you everything.

## The Hierarchy

**Phase alignment (φ) is a gate.** cos²(φ) ranges from 1 to 0. Push in sync and you get full transfer. Push at 90° to the motion and you transfer *nothing* — no matter how strong the force. Push opposite and you actively drain the system. Timing isn't just important. It's a prerequisite.

**Damping (γ) is an amplifier.** Energy scales as 1/γ². Halve the friction and you store *four times* the energy. As damping approaches zero, stored energy diverges toward infinity. This is why resonance disasters happen — bridges collapse, wine glasses shatter. Tiny forces, negligible friction, perfect timing.

**Driving amplitude (F₀) is linear leverage.** Energy scales as F₀². It matters, but it can't rescue bad timing. A whisper at the right moment beats a shout at the wrong one.

## The Punchline

If you want to move energy into a resonant system, your priority list is:

1. **Match the timing** — get phase-aligned with the natural rhythm
2. **Minimize losses** — reduce damping so energy accumulates
3. **Then** turn up the amplitude

Most people fixate on #3. Nature rewards #1.
